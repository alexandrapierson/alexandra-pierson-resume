            <p>
              This is a project built in Figma and has been a case study of
              various design systems and building one of my very own. It's a
              very rudimentary start to a design system but it's covering the
              basics of setting up tokens to store values and the covers the
              differences between primative and secondary tokens.

              This project encompasses my design experience so far, and will by
              the end of this year feature various CSS functionality that allows
              the user to change between the 7 design styles found typically in
              websites. This project is following closely with a design course
              I'm taking and isn't fully flushed out as of yet.
